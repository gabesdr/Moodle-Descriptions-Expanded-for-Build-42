# Moodle-Descriptions-Expanded-for-Build-42
MDE aims to re-write vanilla descriptions to be less vague and provide players with more informational negative or positive status effects caused by in game Moodles by introducing the appropriate +/-% and qualitative ratings to indicate severity of status effects.

This mod is by no means related to any other previous Moodle description mods - This mod is purely based on my own interpretations and of the translators who have contributed to the mod.
